# Part 1: Assembling Spatial and Genetic Data

## Basic inputs for spatial phylogenetics

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- A phylogeny
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Spatial occurrence data
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/phylogeny.png){fig-alt="a phylogeny" height="200"}<br>
![](images/ocurrence.png){fig-alt="an occurrence map" height="200"}
:::

::::

... which are linked by taxonomic names (OTUs)

## Sources of occurrence data

- Herbaria or museums
- Floras or checklists
- Previous studies
- Your own data

## Online sources of occurrence data

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- GBIF
- Kew Plants of the World Online (POWO)
- VertNet

etc...

## GBIF

- GBIF is not one database; it is a portal to many databases

- You should try the web interface first to familiarize yourself with it

- **We can't use the occurrence records in GBIF as-is.** They may include many errors and need to be checked carefully. This will be demonstrated during the coding session.

## Types of occurrence data

Can take many forms:

- geometric shapes
- points
- checklists
- your own surveys

We will focus on point data during the coding session

## Coordinate Reference Systems

- The earth is round, but we project it onto flat maps

- The decision of how to do this is not trivial

- **There will always be some amount of distortion in area, distance, or direction**

## Coordinate Reference Systems

- You need to choose an appropriate CRS for your study (there are thousands)

- If you assume that your sampling units have equal area, make sure to use an equal-area projection

## From occurrences to communities

- Raw data are often provided on a per-species basis

- But we are interested in **assemblages** (communities) of species â†’ need to group species together

## From occurrences to communities

- For point data, a typical method is to divide the study area into equal size grid-cells, then count the species occurring in each grid-cell

- For shape data, you would overlay the shapes

- For checklist data, the communities may not be equal sized. You could simply use the sampling units in the checklist (e.g., counties, countries, etc.)

## Phylogenetic data

- Is there a tree available, or do you need to build it from scratch?

## Sources of DNA sequence data

- GenBank
- access in R via the `rentrez` package

## Building a tree from scratch

We don't have time to cover this today - that is a whole topic of study unto itself!

## Sources of phylogenetic trees

- Previous publications
- Open Tree of Life (`rotl` R package)
- Software that places tips on the tree by taxonomy

## What if I don't have a tree for my group?

- A tree at the species level may not be necessary. Consider doing the analysis at a higher taxonomic level (genus)

## Is it OK to use taxonomy in place of DNA?

In other words, to place species on the tree based on their taxonomy

- Not such a good idea. This makes a lot of assumptions.
  - Monophyly of the taxa involved
  - Correctness of the taxonomy
- Also produces weird trees with lots of polytomies that may not be suitable for spatial phylogenetics

## Taxonomic issues

- Old names
- Misspelled names
- **Mismatching synonyms**

# Part 2: R tools for assembling spatial and genetic data

## Live coding

Live coding session demonstrating how to use `rgbif`, `CoordinateCleaner`, `taxonDB`, and `rotl` to obtain data

Code is available here: <https://github.com/joelnitta/spatial-phy-workshop/blob/main/tutorials/occ_phy.md>

## Workflow

A typical workflow involves the following steps:

1. **Download occurrence records (`rgbif`)**
2. **Clean occurrence records (`CoordinateCleaner`)**
3. **Download (or assemble) tree (`rotl`)**
3. **Standardize species names (`taxonDB`)**
4. Convert points to assemblages (`phyloregion`)
5. Join assemblage data to phylogeny during spatial phylogenetic analysis (`canaper`)

## Other packages

- bdc
- rentrez
  - Interface to Entrez databases (including GenBank) in R
- U.PhyloMaker
  - Assemble phylogenies by grafting species names onto a backbone (this approach is not recommended)
- occCite
  - Downloads occurrence data from GBIF and BIEN, and provides references for all databases that contributed
